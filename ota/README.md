# OTA upload script

Script to upload the built Luftio firmware image.

To get started, add your Luftio AUTH_TOKEN, which you can get from the dashboard network requests.
You will also need an Ngrok account to make the file available over the internet, so you will need to set NGROK_TOKEN.

Afterwards, you can run the script with the device's label as an argument.
